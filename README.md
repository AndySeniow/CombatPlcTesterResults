# Case Study Results

This repository contains the results of a case study conducted to perform an initial validation of the prototype, consisting of four test cases:

- **Test Case 1**: Testing combinatorial logic with and without errors.  
- **Test Case 2**: Testing logic with time functions with and without errors.  
- **Test Case 3**: Testing logic with different data types with and without errors.  
- **Test Case 4**: Testing sequential logic with and without errors.
